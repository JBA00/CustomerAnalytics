Unfortunately There is hardly any chilli in this sauce. So you have to season it with chilli to make it taste good.

23420;Amazon_DE;4,0387E+12;Knorr Tomato al Gusto Pasta Sauce All' Arrabbiata 370 g;07/04/2021;We liked this sauce and have already bought it because it's a quick basic pizza sauce It's ideal if you don't have time to cook yourself. It also tastes good with pasta. Since it doesn't have the typical arrabiata spiciness, even our small children can eat the sauce without complaining. We adults had of course hoped that What's inside is what it says on the tin, but mostly the Knorr bags are mainstream and therefore not so heavily seasoned. Well, you can always add more seasoning. At least it's not as salty as other ready-made sauces. What we particularly like is that it's made from real sauce Italian tomatoes. We don't want any Chinese tomatoes on our plate - and this is often not clearly visible on the packaging. Therefore a good 4 stars!;4;Knorr;Sauces

23429;Amazon_DE;4,0387E+12;Knorr Tomato al Gusto Pasta Sauce All' Arrabbiata 370 g;13/02/2021;"I now prepare my pasta sauces etc. myself as I have a quick stock of spices at home, The taste experience is usually more intense. However, if you don't have it at home, you might try out ready-made sauces from tetrapaks. It should be noted that the whole thing is not new. There are always 500ml jars in the sauce department at all discounters with the simplest pasta sauces (bolognese, napoli, arrabbiata, ricotta, etc.). I always have to say about these sauces that you can taste their production"" because they have a very characteristic taste of their own, which in my opinion cannot be emphasized in a positive way . So I tested this sauce from Knorr to see if there was a taste upgrade. The short answer: unfortunately no. I personally also find this sauce to be too bland. It has a good basic texture and you can taste the tomatoes etc , but if you want to use the sauce as the main flavor carrier in a dish, you will slightly underperform in terms of taste. I also used the sauce for pizza toast, but I had to add some seasoning. And this is definitely recommended when used as a pasta sauce. However, if you would like to prepare your sauce quickly from a tetra pack and don't particularly value the taste, you will probably be completely satisfied with """"to get your carbohydrates"""" here.""";2;Knorr; sauces
23430;Amazon_DE;4,0387E+12;Knorr Tomato al Gusto Pasta Sauce All' Arrabbiata 370 g;24/01/2021;we used the base for a pasta sauce and chopped in cherry tomatoes. the sauce is not too liquid and becomes nice and creamy, we found it pleasantly fruity and tasty.

I always put a lid on it and put a rubber band around it, it's better -) So I tried the sauce once with a teaspoon, of course cold after opening the packaging - nope, who did the contents of the """"grated basil"""" tin fall into the sauce ??? not really my taste. Like a can of chopped tomatoes, the """"Knorr tomato al gusto all' arrabbiata sauce ..."""" has a lot of chopped tomato pieces. The sauce wasn't overly spicy, it may be that other people have a different opinion because it also contains chili. It didn't seem to me that there was any garlic at all, but there was basil. spiral noodles lecka cooked and on top the heated """"knorr tomato al gusto all' arrabbiata sauce ..."""" then tried it, yes, even hot it wasn't my cup of tea, although with the spiral noodles it wasn't quite as intense as it was cold Tried it by teaspoon, no, it's just too much basil. I ate the second portion the next day with spaghetti, there was no love at the second glance either, but I dutifully ate both portions.

I have to admit that my wife added onions and garlic roasted in a little butter to the sauce, but there wasn't any additional seasoning. Maybe one or the other would A little salt, but I usually avoid that. I ate the dish with spaghetti and didn't sprinkle any cheese on top. That way I could (almost) perceive the basic taste and it comes close to what I mean by ‚Äúall' arrabbiata‚Äù. It tastes excellently of tomatoes and definitely has the desired spiciness. Actually, all that's missing now is a little leek and some finely chopped olives, here of course without the pit. But otherwise everything is as it should be and the quantity can accommodate two people get fed up with it, e.g. a salad on the side is enough. In my opinion, the consistency of the product would also make it a good spread on a home-made pizza. Incidentally, I can easily do without adding meat or fish to a dish like this.
