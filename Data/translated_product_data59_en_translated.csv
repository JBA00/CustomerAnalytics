I can agree with that. A sure-fire dish that is on the table after 45 minutes at the latest and feeds at least 2 people. Great cooking skills are not required. We were only moderately impressed with the taste of the finished dish. We prepared it according to the instructions on the package . the ratio of meat to noodles is not right for us personally. We would have preferred significantly more noodles and less meat. Of course you can vary it, but if you increase the proportion of noodles, there is a risk that they will not become soft because they contain liquid missing. Because they are cooked in the oven when raw, using only the oven macaroni sauce. The sauce lacks spice, it tasted bland and tasteless. But you can adjust that by adding your own seasoning. In the end we enjoyed it. Personally, I will not use this Knorr Fix product again. I can manage this meal freshly cooked without the help of a seasoning base and it certainly doesn't take me any longer. But I can't say that the seasoning base for oven macaroni was a complete failure. That's why I rate the product with 3 neutral stars and give a conditional purchase recommendation.;3;Knorr;Snacks & Ready Meals;

But in order to rate it here we tried it out, The instructions are well explained and we didn't have any problems, but the taste of the dish didn't really appeal to us either and that's why we deducted a star because this is always a matter of taste and we probably won't buy it again because we prefer the classic ones again stuffed peppers.;4;Knorr;Snacks & Ready Meals;

Any beginner can do that. It's a good dish in itself, even if it's me It's a bit too musty"". Mince, pasta, cheese... I'm missing vegetables, anything fresh. But everyone can add that if they like. Which is what I also notice in this bag (I just recently I tested the minced sheep's cheese casserole from Knorr and it was the same), the seasoning is very weak. Of course, it's better that way than over-seasoning - after all, you can always add more seasoning, but you can't de-season it - but still, the seasoning could be a little more flavorful be in. Since I've already had the experience as I said, I even seasoned the minced meat properly with salt and pepper when frying it and even then the end product was still rather weak. for quick, effortless cooking, every now and then, certainly not bad, but in the long run it's better not for every day. especially because I personally would miss the fun of cooking.

Since you only have to fry the minced meat and then mix it with water, fix and corn, you don't have much work. Then just another 20-25 minutes Wait until the oven has done the rest for you. I was very pleased that the amount of minced meat, water and corn mixture was perfectly matched to the peppers. The hollowed out peppers are well filled without overflowing.

I recently tried Knorr's noodles with goulash, which I was already very impressed with. The Asian noodles, on the other hand, were a total flop for me. Now here comes another blast, because the mashed potatoes with bacon and onions taste really good for instant. The ingredients, as expected, of course don't read like the shopping list from the organic market, but they are still impressive. Unfortunately there is no content here are stated, I copied this from the packaging so that you can inform yourself: ingredients: 57% potatoes, palm oil, 6% air-dried bacon (pork bacon, table salt), 5% onions, glucose syrup, iodized table salt, milk protein, table salt substitute* , yeast extract, sunflower oil, 0.5% smoked bacon fat (pork bacon, smoke), table salt, chives, parsley, emulsifier mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids, flavors, curcuma, smoke flavor *obtained from natural potassium minerals nutritional information per 100 g energy: 425 kj / 102 kcal, fat: 5.2 g, of which saturated fatty acids: 2.9 g, carbohydrates 10 g, of which sugar 1.2 g, fiber: 1.2 g, protein: 2.5 g, salt 0.78 g if If you look at it like that, I think it's absolutely fine. According to the FSA specifications, the nutritional values ‚Äã‚Äãof fat, salt and sugar are in the middle range. In terms of calories, such a potato snack corresponds to around 20% of an adult's daily requirement. The only thing that should be replaced is the palm oil. And there is one really big disadvantage that I have to criticize about all Knorr snacks and that is the plastic packaging. I'm deducting a star for that, because non-reusable plastic packaging is really outdated. Why shouldn't someone who has a kettle nearby also have a bowl, cup or glass into which he/she could pour the same contents from a bag and prepare something? Even many Asian snacks now only come in bags and Asians are certainly not pioneers when it comes to environmental protection. If you look at the fact that the ratio of fish to plastic in the world's oceans is now 2:1 and the tendency for plastic is increasing, you can imagine without much thought where this is going. At some point the plastic breaks down into microplastics, which the fish cannot distinguish from plankton and in the end, with our carelessness, we eat the plastic together with the sea fish, and we are already doing that.;4;Knorr;Snacks & Ready Meals;

Of course you can spice things up with a chopped tomato. In terms of taste, the casserole is very tasty, but for me personally it could be a little spicier.

It's really quick and easy. You stir the seasoning into the water. You first fry the mince in the pan. Then put everything in a baking dish that already has the noodles in it. It works really well. The taste was good It's ok. I would have liked a slightly more intense taste. But well, that's just a matter of taste. I like the information on the packaging: no flavor-enhancing additives. Also: no preservatives. Among the ingredients, tomato powder is listed first. Sugar second . then flavors, iodized table salt. This explains the carbohydrate value of 12 g per 100 g. In my opinion, the herbs would have been added after the tomato powder. Then the taste would probably have been more intense. I would definitely use the product again. but only now and then.;4;Knorr;Snacks & Ready Meals;

The preparation"" if you follow the recipe on the back, only a few ingredients are needed, which are quick to prepare. I have cooked this recipe several times and find it really tasty. However, if you follow the scenario above and you don't get any fresh If you have minced meat at home, it's also easy to use vegetables. Simply chop the vegetables you have, fry them in the pan and stir in the seasoning base with water. Then pour into the baking dish lined with macaroni and pour over the cr√©me l√©g√©re and cheese. you can also use sour cream as an alternative. ‚Äúthe taste‚Äù after 30 minutes in the oven, the dish is ready and we can serve it. The sprinkled cheese (I recommend gratin cheese) gives us a nice, crispy layer. The noodles are completely cooked through and, like the vegetables, are soaked in the seasoning-based sauce. This means everything is nice and soft and juicy, but not too mushy. There was no need for seasoning, Knorr had already helped us out. The seasoning base is perfectly balanced and goes perfectly with the ingredients used. It tastes delicious too, you can't complain about that. ¬ªMy conclusion¬´ As we know, cooking yourself tastes best and I usually follow this principle. But when things have to go quickly, I like to use Knorr Fix products and I'm not disappointed. The clever thing about this recipe is that you don't have to cook the macaroni, which really saves a lot of time and work. You can taste that it's a bag of product, but it's by no means bad, it's delicious in its own way and a good alternative when you're in a hurry.

Otherwise we cook fresh. We don't want to judge finished products per se, but rather the preparation, taste and ease of work. First of all, the packaging and the ingredients. at first glance Everything reads very well and the packaging is attractively designed. The ingredients are okay, but unfortunately it contains sugar and yeast extract. I think the vegan seal is positive. Even if the suggested preparation is not vegan, you are still free to choose it what we did. We decided on a vegetarian version of the oven macaroni. The preparation was easy and with the instructions even people with little understanding of cooking can do it. Simply put uncooked pasta in a casserole dish, fry the meat (for us veggie mince), add 1/2 liter of water and the contents of the bag and bring to the boil. Pour the meat sauce over the pasta and, if necessary, top with creme legere and cheese and bake in the oven at 200¬∞C for 30 minutes. really easy and fast. However, I find that cooking fresh doesn't take much longer. I would estimate 10 minutes longer if the sauce is made and seasoned yourself. We liked it. You can certainly do that every now and then.

I find it very pleasant that you usually don't have to buy a lot of ingredients (here only macaroni, minced meat, cr√®me l√©g√®re and cheese) and you also save yourself a large stock of different spices. So that the food doesn't get too greasy Here the lower-fat versions of the ingredients are recommended, such as lean minced meat or cr√®me l√©g√®re instead of cr√®me fra√Æche. The preparation is simple: fry the minced meat, then add water and fix. Then everything goes into a baking dish together with uncooked pasta, where the cr√®me l√©g√®re and The cheese is added. The oven does the rest of the work within about 30 minutes. The taste of this meal is rather unspectacular, but still quite good. When it comes to the ingredients, I'm pleased that, for once, the usual palm oil is missing. However, the addition of sugar, flavors and yeast extract is as usual.;4;Knorr;Snacks & Ready Meals;

We have made a slight modification to the recipe over the years. We use 3 of these pancakes in a large baking dish together with 1kg of minced meat and 500g of pasta. We use 2 pans for frying (a 24 and a 28 with a half-height rim) the minced meat is divided into the two pans: two thirds in the large one, a third in the bran. Then fry the minced meat with a little oil at a high temperature until all the liquid is out. then cold Add water: 600ml in the small pan, 1200ml in the large pan (we do not use the creme legere, so the 100ml liquid from there can be used as water). Then pour out the packets, one in the small pan, 2 in the large one pan. Then let it simmer at a medium to high temperature until the brownish-yellow foam has completely dissolved. As the minutes go by, the foam becomes redder and redder as you stir and at some point it disappears completely or is no longer noticeable, only then is it finished simmering. Then pour the contents of the small pan into the baking dish as a ‚Äúbottom‚Äù. Distribute the minced meat evenly over the surface. Then pour the raw pasta onto this base (without stirring) (we use gluten-free spiral pasta, but any type of pasta works). Here too, make sure that the noodles are at an even height everywhere and then pour the contents of the large pan over them. Then spread the minced meat on top evenly and make sure that no noodle sticks out (otherwise it will be rock hard after baking. Then sprinkle a packet of grated cheese (150g-200g) over it and put it in the oven according to the instructions on the package.

If you're hungry in between, this potato snack from Knorr is delicious and also filling. Of course, it's not a complete meal in the long run, but every now and then , certainly not harmful either. The price is a little higher than in the store.;4;Knorr;Snacks & Ready Meals;

You can just as easily cook a tomato pasta casserole yourself, because you have to buy the ingredients individually anyway and you probably have salt and pepper in the house. An extra can of tomatoes and it will be tastier than with this bag . the seasoning mixture tastes relatively bland and salty. I would definitely not offer it to guests. Not even to children. You should only buy a product like this if you absolutely cannot cook at all - and the second time you do it, you'll just do it the same way without a bag and with your own spices. That's cheaper, healthier and tastes better. The fact that it contains yeast extract, but is not considered a flavor enhancer after the setting, is a joke. But Knorr can't do anything about that.;2;Knorr; Snacks & Ready Meals;

In terms of taste, I think it's a very good basis for a baking dish full of oven macaroni. Overall, I would say this dish is nothing that you wouldn't be able to achieve without an appropriate ready-made mixture. The taste is a bit off to me in some places Too intense but we all still enjoyed it, the amount of cheese stated on the package was of course absolutely not enough, but we're almost mice when it comes to this topic :) overall it was a bit like a ready-made lasagna - I wish I had noodles and cooked it ourselves, but with a quick fix and it inspired us to cook the same dish again in a slightly different form. So I would say overall for me it is a very good product, but you don't necessarily have to always have one in stock, you can do the whole thing It's also good to make your own with tomato paste or pureed tomatoes and some spices and herbs, but if you need to go quicker, it's certainly a good alternative.

This could be difficult with purely fresh produce, so ready-made products are a good option! This type of comfort food is practical and quick to prepare and... yes and what? Doesn't taste that good at all bad, but very salty (one serving already covers about a third of your daily requirement) and spiced up with palm oil and yeast extract. The latter does not necessarily have to be declared as a flavor enhancer, but in fact it is nothing else! However, the package says ""without flavor-enhancing additives "", which again is correct, because yeast extract is considered a food and not an additive. There is no legal objection in this respect, but the bottom line is that the consumer still feels like they are being tricked. After all, the main ingredient of this product is potatoes, but otherwise it doesn't have much in common with grandmother's vegetable kitchen. But can you accuse a product of not being something it shouldn't be? I think no. The Knorr Snack Bar is not designed to be a full-fledged kitchen, and anyone who eats it exclusively has only themselves to blame. On the other hand, you don't necessarily have to wait for a catastrophe to happen like the soldier with his one-man package (EPA)! This meal is ok for occasional use in the office, when one appointment follows the next and there isn't enough time for a proper lunch break, or for the single household whose only resident doesn't always feel like cooking for themselves!

To prepare it you also need: 150 grams of macaroni, 300 grams of minced meat, 100 grams of creme legere (I used creme fraiche ) and 50 grams of cheese (I used grated Emmental cheese). First you need a baking dish into which you put the uncooked macaroni. The minced meat is fried as usual in the pan, into which you then add 500 ml of water. That's why it is recommended To use a pan as high as possible or to transfer the fried meat into a casserole dish. The contents of the bag are added to the water and brought to the boil briefly. You can then pour the minced meat with the boiled sauce into the baking dish with the macaroni. Then add the creme fraiche and grated cheese on top and put the casserole in the oven. I preheated it to 175 degrees with a fan and then put the casserole in it for about 30 minutes. The casserole tastes very good, the macaroni rose well and became soft. There is nothing wrong with the taste of the sauce, I find it very tasty. For me alone, the casserole lasts about 3 days, even then it still tastes very good if you keep it in the fridge in the meantime.

I had correspondingly high expectations for this seasoning mixture, as it was advertised as tasting like mother's. But unfortunately it was a total failure (or Knorr's mother was just not a good one cook). The sauce was totally runny and somehow didn't taste like anything, seasoned with only salt and pepper. Something was missing, but I don't know what. In any case, it was a taste disaster! It was time for dinner with my parents again . then I thought that I could try the spice mixture from Knorr once to get several opinions. The conclusion was that we all thought the same thing: we won't get that again. It doesn't taste like anything and is as liquid as water. The quantity stated on the bag is correct. You can count on 3 portions per bag. When you buy this pack you only get the spice mix and you have to buy the required ingredients. These are 150g thin macaroni, 300g lean mixed minced meat, 100g cr√®me l√©g√®re and 50g grated cheese (16% fat). Preparation is a bit complicated as the stove and oven are required for this dish. 1) If necessary, the uncooked, thin macaroni is broken in half and placed in a baking dish. 2) the meat is fried with a tablespoon of hot oil and 500ml of cold water is added. The contents of the bag are then stirred in and brought to the boil. 3) the sauce is poured into a baking dish and distributed evenly. Then add the cr√®me l√©g√®re and cheese on top and bake in a preheated oven at 200¬∞c (fan oven 175¬∞c) for around 30 minutes. While eating we noticed that the sauce was as runny as water and some of the noodles (presumably the ones on the bottom) were very firm to the bite. You didn't taste the cheese, just the pasta and the mince. Later we simply added tomato ketchup and it tasted great (just as it would without the spice mix!). ~ conclusion ~ a relatively complicated dish that can also be prepared more easily and quickly. If you simply used tomato ketchup (e.g. from Heinz) instead of the seasoning mixture and just pasta and minced meat, you would only have used a cooking pot and would have had a meal within 30 minutes, which is much cheaper and also requires less effort. I'm sorry, but I can't recommend this seasoning mixture with the best will in the world. A big thank you goes to all readers of my review. I hope that my review was useful and that you were able to get a small impression of the Knorr fix oven macaroni alla mamma.;1;Knorr;Snacks & Ready Meals;

The powder can be dissolved easily in the water without there being any lumps, the spices in the sauce are clearly visible and you can also smell the fruitiness through tomatoes. This is reflected in the taste and you can taste tomatoes and different spices can. We find the taste quite natural, not artificial, which is of course a big bonus.

So I largely avoid meat and rarely eat fish. In order to get some variety and save on work, I wanted to try the Knorr √° la Mama macaroni. The preparation is surprisingly quick, if you don't want to add any ingredients yourself. However I didn't do without garlic and two small onions. I would have liked to have added fresh peppers, but I would have had to buy it first. I didn't add meat and also the cheese. I did everything as described in the instructions for the preparation and .. well - it certainly doesn't taste the same as if you prepared everything fresh yourself. And especially since I've been using tomatoes more often lately for fruity tomato sauces, the difference is noticeable - but not bad at all. In my opinion, the ingredients are okay and also give the spice mixture a tasty note. The 'tomato taste' is not too artificial, although not like fresh tomatoes, which is self-explanatory. I have to admit that it was the first time that I prepared pasta in this way without having to prepare it separately. They all turned out well and even retained a bit of bite. Something like this is a welcome product for a quick and hasty meal or for a meal without much effort. especially if you don't have time to go shopping.;4;Knorr;Snacks & Ready Meals;

If your stomach is growling and you're on the go or you just don't feel like serving yourself something fresh on the stove, reaching for the ready-made food shelf is the quickest way to a full stomach. The portion size is suitable for everyday use and should be good for you I think the amount of salt of 2 g for a portion cup is a bit high. When I make fresh mashed potatoes I add far less salt. But don't let me make the puree mad for you because of that, with the bacon (6 % & onions (5%) it actually doesn't taste bad. I made the snack according to the instructions and the mixture mixed well without any lumps of powder or anything like that forming.

I like this potato snack with bacon & onions from Knorr. Because on the one hand you don't really expect much from a finished product like this, but on the other hand you don't want it to taste really bad. And surprisingly, this mashed potatoes with bacon and onions actually taste really good to me. The roasted flavors of the onions are really good To be fair, it doesn't dominate the finished dish. The bacon is clearly noticeable when you eat it. It's crunchy and has a very pleasantly smoky taste. In general, the dish is seasoned perfectly. Just enough so that it doesn't taste bland, but not too exaggerated, like that that something tastes unpleasant. Fortunately, the consistency is actually perfect. Not too runny and not too thick. But just like good mashed potatoes should be. optimal! On the list of ingredients, potatoes come first at 57%. and many ingredients are also from sustainable cultivation. In addition, the product does not contain any colorings or flavor enhancers. That also speaks for the cup puree. Speaking of cups: of course such a plastic item is still bad for the environment. But: you can easily tear off the outer paper and then properly dispose of the paper or cardboard and cups separately. And when you remove the outer packaging you can see that the plastic is fortunately very thin. So far: I think the finished products are getting better and better and their taste is becoming more and more natural. In any case, this potato snack surprised me very positively.;5;Knorr;Snacks & Ready Meals;

But it is very important to follow the preparation exactly. You should stir as soon as possible after adding water - and do so very thoroughly. Otherwise you will notice later that there are still remnants of the powder stuck to the bottom. If you don't like the puree that thick , you should pour in a little more water straight away. 5mm above the mark in the cup turned out to be correct for me. The puree is still thickening a bit and should be stirred really vigorously again after the waiting time.

The individual ingredients are also listed here, including palm oil, yeast extract and sugar. Thanks to the instructions on the package, the preparation is very simple and easy to understand. After the specified cooking time, the contents of the peppers are not dry, but have a juicy consistency. In terms of taste, the result is also quite okay, although for me it could be a bit more seasoned. But next time you can add a little more.

The question was always what to do with the rest with a 400g or 500g pack. The problem is eliminated without minced meat and the casserole almost becomes a thing Backup dish that you can always make. The other reason is that I think the minced meat doesn't add much to the enjoyment of the casserole.
